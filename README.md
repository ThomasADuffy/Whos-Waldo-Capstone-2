# **Introduction**
Ever since I was a kid, I was terrible at where’s waldo . It has been a bugging issue until today where I can conquer over Waldo with machine learning and convoluted neural networks. On a more serious note, everybody has heard of or has played Where’s Waldo?(also known as Wheres Wally?). Being very intrested in Neural Networks, I wanted to create a Convolutional Neural Network(CNN) which is able to tell if an image is Waldo or not. I also used Tensorflow and Keras to create the CNN and also utilized my GPU to run my CNN which made training magnitudes faster than training on a CPU. Other libraries I utilized was Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Scikit-Image, and some other basic libraries. I created the code to be able to run on any computer which downloads the scripts due to utilizing the os, sys libraries and making import/export directories universal per computer. This ended up in three main classes I utilized and three jupiter notebooks which were used for EDA, testing, and plotting.
